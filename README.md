# Econometrics using STATA

**This is .md file without latex support on github**

## Objective



This is notes and reviews from Econometrics 2017 Fall of SMU Economics Curriculum. While the primary purpose of this book will remain as study material and eventually a reference in the future to be merged into the Github page for record, I'm also writing this notebook in hopes that it could serve as guidance and support materials for students seeking to teach themselves Econometrics and STATA.

The book will be written under following three principles:

**1. Everything will be explicit: **I will make sure to explain every single variable and terminology. While I doubt anyone will read this book without background in statistics and economics, I want to design this book so anyone with willingness to learn can follow the text regardless of their background.

**2. There will be summaries:** While the nature of being explicit overlaps with being verbose, I will make sure to include summaries that gets the "juice" of the notes. The Exam Review Chapters are these summary sections. Nothing is more annoying than having to read a whole page of text in order to pick up a couple lines of information that pertains to you. Life is short, so read the summaries.

**3. I will use "Normee" Terms:** Sounding elegant is great, but not at the cost of being imprecise. If I'm not succinct in delivering this information then this text has lost its purpose. I will make sure to express the relevant information in succinct and precise terms even if it comes at a cost of being dull.

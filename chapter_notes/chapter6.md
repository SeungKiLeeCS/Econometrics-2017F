## Change in Unit of Measurement



###Dependent Variable (y)

For dependent variable, if you change the OZ to lb on a regression, it is the same as multiplying the result calculated for Î² will change by the ratio between the change in measurement. Since 16oz = 1lb, the coefficients will be multiplied by the same amount as the dependent variable unit

###Independent Variable (x)

Same as the dependent variable, but the change will be limited to the specific independent variable.

###Logarithmic Changes

if the changes are made in logarithms, their will be no change in coefficients because you're already taking the percentage form of the coefficient.

In this case, the intercept will change instead of the coefficients.

### Question:by what amount? 



### Beta Coefficient or Standarized Coefficient

$\hat{Z}$ has no intercept value, because you're running this with standarized values on Y. The equation for this is at

## $Z \ = \ x-\hat{x} \over \sigma$
